Vertical alignment of content inside table cells

Release 2021-04-15

Overview
--------

This package offers low-level macros to build rows with 
vertically-aligned cells (top, middle or bottom) and 
calculate the height of a row. Those cells can have 
variable or fixed height and can be paragraph-cells 
or inline-cells. Different vertical alignments can be 
used in the same row.

Documentation
