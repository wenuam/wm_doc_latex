Two new text positioning commands are defined: \tabto and \tab.
 
\tabto{<length>} and \tabto*{<length>}
Tab to a specified position relative to the left margin in a paragraph
They differ when the text on the line already goes past the desired
position: \tabto gives a line break whereas \tabto* backspaces.

\tab
Tab to the next tab-stop chosen from a list of tab positions, in
the traditional style of typewriters. The tab-stop positions are 
declared using either \TabPositions{<length>, <length>,...<length>}
or \NumTabs{<number>}.
