A smart font contains not only letter shapes but also additional instructions indicating how to combine and position the letters in complex ways. Graphite was primarily developed to provide the flexibility needed for minority languages which often need to be written according to slightly different rules than well-known languages that use the same script. </TPM:Description><TPM:RunFiles size="237273">texmf\tpm\packages\miktex-graphite2-bin-x64-2.9.tpm texmf\miktex\bin\x64\MiKTeX250400-graphite2.dll</TPM:RunFiles><TPM:TimePackaged>1745746951</TPM:TimePackaged><TPM:MD5>9590cc574052323514a97d9d42c673dc</TPM:MD5><TPM:Copyright owner="SIL International" year="2010"/><TPM:License type="lgpl2.1"/></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
